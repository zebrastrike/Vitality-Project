    title: 'Tissue Repair & Recovery',
    body: `A significant body of preclinical research has examined synthetic peptides derived from naturally occurring growth factors and body-protective proteins. Studies published in peer-reviewed journals have investigated mechanisms related to tendon and ligament fibroblast activity, gastrointestinal mucosal integrity, and angiogenesis. Compounds in this category have shown activity in rodent models across a range of connective tissue contexts.`,
  },
  {
    icon: Dna,
    title: 'Body Composition & Metabolic Research',
    body: `Growth hormone secretagogues and GHRH analogues represent an active area of endocrinology research. Academic interest centers on pulsatile GH release patterns, IGF-1 axis modulation, and downstream effects on lean mass, adipose tissue, and insulin sensitivity. This research area has historically attracted both pharmaceutical and academic investigation.`,
  },
  {
    icon: Sparkles,
    title: 'Cellular Longevity & Skin Biology',
    body: `Tripeptide-copper complexes occur naturally in human plasma and have been studied extensively for their role in extracellular matrix remodeling, collagen biosynthesis stimulation, and antioxidant enzyme upregulation. Research interest spans wound healing biology, dermatology, and hair follicle science. Independent groups have published findings across multiple tissue types.`,
  },
  {
    icon: Brain,
    title: 'Neuromodulation & Cognitive Research',
    body: `Anxiolytic peptides with tuftsin-derived structures have been studied primarily in Eastern European research institutions for their modulation of GABAergic and serotonergic pathways. Research applications have explored anxiety-related behavioral models, working memory paradigms, and immune-neurological crosstalk without the sedative profiles associated with classical anxiolytics.`,
