          <p className="text-gray-900/60 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Peptides exert their biological effects by binding to specific receptors — protein
            structures embedded in cell membranes or located within the cell interior. Each receptor
            has a binding pocket with a unique three-dimensional shape and charge distribution. When
            a peptide with the complementary structure encounters that receptor, it docks into the
            binding site with high affinity and specificity.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-900/60 leading-relaxed">
            This interaction is often described using the &quot;induced fit&quot; model: the receptor
            undergoes a subtle conformational change upon peptide binding, which activates the
            receptor and prepares it to transmit a signal to the cell interior. The precision of this
            fit is what distinguishes peptide signaling from broader pharmacological mechanisms —
            peptides engage their targets with minimal off-target interaction.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Signal Transduction</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-900/60 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Once a peptide binds its receptor, the activated receptor initiates an intracellular
            signaling cascade — a chain of molecular events that amplifies and transmits the message
            deeper into the cell. Common transduction pathways studied in peptide research include:

          <ul className="text-gray-900/60 text-sm leading-relaxed space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li>
              <span className="text-brand-400 font-medium">G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways</span>{' '}
              — The largest family of membrane receptors, GPCRs relay signals through intracellular
              G-proteins that activate secondary messengers such as cAMP or calcium ions.

              <span className="text-brand-400 font-medium">Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathways</span>{' '}
              — Peptide growth factors and certain hormones signal through RTKs, which
              autophosphorylate upon ligand binding and activate downstream cascades including
              MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt.

          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-900/60 leading-relaxed">
            Each of these pathways has been extensively characterized in the literature, and
            peptide-receptor interactions remain a central focus of pharmacological and biochemical
            research.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Pathway Specificity vs Broad Compounds</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-900/60 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            One of the most significant advantages of peptides as research tools is their pathway
            specificity. Unlike many small-molecule compounds that interact with multiple receptor
            types or enzymes simultaneously, peptides are typically designed — by nature or by
            synthesis — to engage a single receptor or a narrow family of related receptors.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-900/60 leading-relaxed">
            This specificity allows researchers to isolate and study individual pathways without the
            confounding effects of off-target activity. In preclinical models, this property makes
            peptides invaluable for mapping signaling networks, identifying downstream effectors, and
            understanding the causal relationships between receptor activation and biological
            outcomes.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">The Role of Sequence in Determining Function</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-900/60 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            A peptide&apos;s amino acid sequence is the sole determinant of its receptor target and
            signaling behavior. Even minor modifications — substituting a single amino acid,
            altering chirality from L- to D-form, or adding a protective group — can dramatically
            change binding affinity, metabolic stability, or receptor selectivity.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-900/60 leading-relaxed">
            This structure-activity relationship (SAR) is one of the most active areas of peptide
            research. By systematically modifying sequences and measuring the resulting changes in
            biological activity, researchers build detailed maps of how molecular structure translates
            to function — knowledge that informs both basic science and applied research.
